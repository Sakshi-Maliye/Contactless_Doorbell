# Contactless_Doorbell
Overview
This project uses a Raspberry Pi with an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a buzzer, and a Raspberry Pi Camera Module to create a doorbell-like system. When an object is detected within 100 cm of the sensor, the system triggers a buzzer and captures an image with a timestamped filename.
